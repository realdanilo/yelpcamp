# Yelp Camp +

Hello! This is my final version for my bootcamp project. :D
Yelpcamp is a full REST and CRUD application  that allows a user to share cool images/location from their adventures.

This website uses **NEMO** stack. Stands for: Node JS, Express, Mongo DB, and Others; such as Bootstrap and Mapbox.
This is the revised version which uses **ES6+** and **MVC** architecture
 1. Authentication using Passport
 2. Cascade Delete
 3. MapBox Api
 4. Nested Routes
 5. User Profile
 6. Admin Config
 7. Upload/Update Images - Cloudinary
 8. EJS

You can find the app here: [https://danilocamp.herokuapp.com/campgrounds](https://danilocamp.herokuapp.com/campgrounds)

Cheers :D
